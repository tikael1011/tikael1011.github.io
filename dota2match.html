This is about the dota2 match. What I want to do is to predicate which side will win the game based on their lineup (or ban-pick if in captain mode)
First for the data collection part, where are some target websites, such as dotabuff and dotamax.
The problem is how/what will I scrape. The methods may be based on how I will build my NN, but then I figure out I should store info as much as possible.
Do not worry about no enough data to train my NN, just do something then take next move.
Since I do not have a server or cloud service(aws), PCA or NN proning may be required, but still I am on the data collecting stage.
