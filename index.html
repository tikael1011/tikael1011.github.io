											<h1>Dissipating<br />

										<p>I am a CS major master student in Umass Boston,graduating May 2017.
											I want to be a software engineer or data scientist. This website is mainly about
											projects I have done or am doing. I stick to NDA, so no worries. "TRIVIA" contains description of each projects. Construciton is undergoing.</p>

												<h3>IndoorNav</h3>
												<p4>Main language: Java, Python </p4> </br>
												<!--p>This research proejct simulates the following (similar) situation: A gunman shows up inside a building, and people start to evacuate. They open our app, then they know where they are and will receive evacuation routes based on their current location. There are four main parts of this project: wifi signal strength based localization, route planning, image processing and SDN (software defined network). </br>
												My work is mainly on wifi part and I am responsible for integration of the whole program. </br>
											    One of the challenge I met is that the signal strength varies along time and other factors. The second is that utilizing signal strength alone is not enough to achieve high accuracy (error < 1m). The third is that while people using our app, they move fast. We should try to minimalize the delay both in communication between app and server and localization/route computation.</p-->
											    <p4>My work is mainly on the follwing parts:</br>
											    • Develop user app. This app is able to</p4>
												<div style="text-indent: 2em">∆ start active scan AP, which helps Kismet detection and collect AP info 
												</br><div style="text-indent: 2em">∆ establish FTP connection to server, send current AP info and receive evacuation route
												</br><div style="text-indent: 2em">∆ navigate user to exit based on preintalled map</br>
												• Wifi signal strength based localization. There are many existing technologies/methods. But they either require extra hardware(e.g. Chrono MIT,2016) or can't meet our accuracy requirement(e.g. decision tree, SVM), or require relative long computation time. Thus a new model is required.
												</br>
												• Combine image processing (Raspberry Pi + camera) to improve accuracy and reduce computation time, especially user is near an intersection. Through human recognition, we can also achieve flow control.</br>
												• Evacuation route algorithm design. Our current algorithm blocks all the hallways and rooms, which are directly connected to gunman's location and a cirle with center point of gunman's location and a radius of 20 meters.</br></br> Future work:</br> 
												<div style="text-indent: 2em">• Better UI design, multi layouts and SSH connection instead of FTP.</br>
												<div style="text-indent: 2em">• Introduce time series method, may be able to improve accuracy.</br>
												<div style="text-indent: 2em">• Current time complexity is O(nˆ2), n is number of points that describe the floor map. Try to optimize to O(nlog(n)) and calculate multi routes simultaneously.

												<h3>Text Semantic Recognition</h3>
												<p4>Main language: Python</p4></br>
												<p4>partial results can be seen at <p4><a href = "http://158.121.178.175/">here</a></br>
												<!--p>The purpose of this project can be described as following: Something bad happend.(in our research, we use 2014 W.VA chemical spill as example) The governor needs to make a speech about it and he/she wants to receive positive feedback from the public, thus timing and content become very important. We research wants to help him/her to make that decision. </br>
												One thing I struggled with is to deal with negation and sarcasm. The other thing is that in my opinion, traing dataset is not sufficient. Adding more dataset, e.g. 2010 BP oil spill may improve the result.</p-->
												<p4>My work is mainly on the follwing parts:</br>
											    • Write Python crawler for twitter and nbc news, utlize 'requests' and 'beautifulsoup4' library. If I write crawlers again, I will try to connect them to the database instead of putting content in a local txt file.</br>
											    • After extract time, location and other info from the original data via Stanford NER tools,

												<h3>Text Simplification</h3>
												<p4>Main language: Java, Python </p4>
												<!--p>This is a co-op project with UMMS, designed for people with CD(cognitive disability). We did two main methods, one is rule-based and the other is machine learning.</p-->

												<h3>Questioning and Answering System</h3>
												<p4>Main language: Java </p4>
												<p>This is a co-op research project with UMMS, IBM and WPI. Mainly purpose is to determine whether an article is friendly to people with CD. How do we measure that? We achieve this by calculating the correlation between "Rougue System rating" and manual rating. If the correlation is high, then we can use program instead of human, which is faster and more ojective.</p>

												<h3>Machine Learning Coursework</h3>
												<p4>Main language: Python, C </p4>
												<p>Main website: <a href="http://imanmk.github.io/MLKDD/">here</a> </br>
													dropbox: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qu9agmuvcevuynk/AADqs8-getvwxMsJEqSLj6ACa?dl=0">here</a> </br>
													evaluation: <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~ding/history/438_638_spring_2016/student.htm">here</a> </br>
													I performed a feature engineering role. And my the biggest contribution to improve RMSE is introduced a new KNN variant. </br>
													One of the problem we met was that the dataset is large, nearly 1.2 million steps. Training, testing and validation take some amount of time. Our group had no access to server or cloud service like AWS, so our solution is multi-threading and cython. </br>
													Another one is that we have to decide what methods we will combine into our blender.
