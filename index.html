								<h1>Jie's Website</h1>
								<p>Dear visitors, I suppose you have had my resume and want to see more details. If you haven't, shoot me an email at <a href="#">jqian170@gmail.com</a></br>
							For old version of my website, please check <a href="oldversion/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I have decided to use a new theme on 9/6/2017, I mean re-build the whole thing, honestly.
							</br>
							You might want to visit either "Software Engineering" or "Data Science". Construction of "Other Projects" is always undergoing, 
							</br>because there are numerous new ones upcoming.
							</br> This website is far from finish, but still I want to release it. I would like to see progress is being made every single day.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Software Engingeering</h2>
								<h3>Preface:</h3>
								<p>IMHO, engineering is more about 'how' and 'what'. This does not mean questions like 'why this data structure', 'what are the cons and pros of this' does not matter. To the contrary, they are important as well. My opinion can be wrong but literally that is what I pay attention/adhere to. Problem solving skills are the <b>KEY</b>.</p>
								<h4>Indoor Nav Project </h4>
									<p>
										 <i>➤ why the database was ONLY in 1NF? and what was the schema?</i>
									</br>A: There are reasons why people need 1NF, 2NF, 3NF or even BCNF. Like <b>minimize</b> duplicates, simplify queries. But my usage is pretty simple and I do not even need primary key (no indexing required as well). My table (relational database) has 38238 rows and 3 columns. The schema is 'Point Name' (varchar(6)), 'AP Name'(char(17)), Strength(tinyint). For the 'Strength' part, data type was float(24) (not 53) and our localization algorithm shows that there is barely an accuracy difference between int/float input, so I switched to tinyint.
									</br>
									</br><i>➤Did you use proxy? Any load balance? distibuted server?</i>
									</br>A: No. Our app connected to server directly and we only had one server, I did not participate in server/network part much in our team.<b>However</b>, in terms of load balance, I thought of two strategies, the 'simplest' round-robin one and the 'lease connection' one. 
									</br>
									</br><i>➤ How extactly is the concurrency problem and how you solve it?</i>
									</br>A: It was that when user moves to a new location, the route does not update accordingly. The other one was originally, our app did not keep being connected to server and sent connect request too often, thus after few seconds the firewall mechanism blocked our requests.
									</br>
									</br><i>➤ Any trade-off for the computation time reduction? and in detail, how?</i>
									</br>A: I applied threee tricks.
									</br>
									</br><i>➤  What UML model?</i>
									</br>A: Functional and object model.
									</p>
								<h4>Simplfication and QA Project</h4>
									<p>
										 1. Some usage questions about python argparse.
									</br>2. Why did you rewrite the retrieval part? Add more functionlity? Performance improvement?
									</br> This is designed for people with CD, and we do not know if we will have connection to internet or not and we want to get local results only. The main reason I mentioned this I want to demonstrate the experience in Linux/bash, grep, awk and so forth.
									</br>3. Why after LDA model, the results was improved?</p>
								<h4>Sentiment Analysis Project</h4>
									<p>
										 1. More details about the crawler? How did you utilize the API and tweepy? Format, database, server load...
									</p>
								<h4>KDD Cup Project</h4>
									<p>
										 1. How did you filter data? what rule did you apply and any trade-off? And why you want to perform filtering?
									</br>2. How did you maintain version control? How do you understand the scm/version control? Is it important and why?
									</br>A: Our team had four numbers and only two person were contridutors. The others had to make pull requests and sometimes we merged and sometimes we created a new branch/fork.

								<h2 class="major">Data Science</h2>
								<h3>Preface:</h3>
								<p>IMHO, science is more about 'why' and what is behind the scene/data/results, e.g. mathematics. And sometimes we can get insights during the evaluation phase rather than the modeling/analysing phase. Analytic skill is the <b>KEY</b>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Other Projects</h2>
								<p>Honestly, I am pondering over a good way to represent/classify them, so that this page follows some logic, I mean, organized. Some are mini projects from web, some are individual ones, some are just ideas but I believe worth talking about, some are open source projects on github. And for the data science project, in terms of methods, deep learning will be my first choice. I believe I will have individual page for each (medium/large) project.</p>
								<h4>Dota2 match predication</h4>
								<p>This one has nothing to do with the opendata project on Kaggle. It is my own research. So far I am on the data collection phase.</p>
								<h4>soccer match predication</h4>
								<p></p4>
								<h4>Stop Sign Recognization (self-driving car)</h4>
								<h4>BattleShip Game AI (in both Haskell and Python)</h4>
								<h4>Quora Challenges</h4>
								<h4>OpenNMT Related Project (github)</h4>
								<p>This one is based on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02499.pdf">paper(IJCAI 2017)</a>. And github link is <a href="https://github.com/tikael1011/storyreader-py">here</a></p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>The contents in software engineering and data science are somehow limited, because they were done during my master's study and it is not very likely I will further improve them. I did learn a lot from being a research assistant.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Log</h2>
								<p>9/7/2017, v0.01 online, very basic.</p>
