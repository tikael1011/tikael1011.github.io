								<p>Dear visitors, I suppose you have had my resume and want to see more details. If you haven't, shoot me an email at <a href="#">jqian170@gmail.com</a></br>
							For old version of my website, please check <a href="oldversion/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I have decided to use a new theme on 9/6/2017.
							</br>
							You might want to visit either "Software Engineering" or "Data Science". Construction of "Other Projects" is always undergoing, 
							</br>because there are numerous new ones upcoming.
							</br> This website is far from finish, but still I want to release it. I would like to see progress is being made every single day.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Software Engingeering</h2>
								<h3>Preface:</h3>
								<p>IMHO, engineering is more about 'how' and 'what'. This does not mean questions like 'why this data structure', 'what are the cons and pros of this' does not matter. To the contrary, they are important as well. My opinion can be wrong but literally that is what I pay attention/adhere to. Problem solving skill is the <b>KEY</b>.</p>
								<h4>Indoor Nav Project </h4>
									<p>
										 1. I guess you have questions about the database, at least why it is ONLY in 1NF?
									</br>2. Did I use proxy? Any load balance? distibuted server?
									</br>3. How extactly is the concurrency problem and how you solve it?
									</br>4. Any trade-off for the computation time reduction? and in detail, how?
									</br>5. What model? Why UML?
									</p>
								<h4>Simplfication and QA Project</h4>
									<p>
										 1. Some usage questions about python argparse.
									</br>2. Why did you rewrite the retrieval part? Add more functionlity? Performance improvement?
									</br>3. Why after LDA model, the results was improved?</p>
								<h4>Sentiment Analysis Project</h4>
									<p>
										 1. More details about the crawler? How did you utilize the API and tweepy? Format, database, server load...
									</p>
								<h4>KDD Cup Project</h4>
								<h4>Complier Project</h4>

								<h2 class="major">Data Science</h2>
								<h3>Preface:</h3>
								<p>IMHO, science is more about 'why' and what is behind the scene/data/results, e.g. mathematics. And sometimes we can get insights during the evaluation phase rather than the modeling/analysing phase. Analytic skill is the <b>KEY</b>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Other Projects</h2>
								<p>Honestly, I am pondering over a good way to represent/classify them, so that this page follows some logic, I mean, organized. Some are mini projects from web, some are individual ones, some are just ideas but I believe worth talking about, some are open source porjects on github...</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>The contents in software engineering and data science are somehow limited, because they were done during my master's study and it is not very likely I will further improve them.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Log</h2>
								<p>9/7/2017, v0.01 online, very basic.</p>
