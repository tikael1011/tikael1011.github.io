This is mainly for self-driving car. Plain text plus some graph and codes should be good enough, isn't it?

Proposal:

Problem/Related Work:

How accurate should we achieve? 90%? 95%? or even 99.9%

Is image recognition reliable ? what about take weather and day/night into consideration. what about red color fade?
Is octagon detection 100% correct ? what about multi-sign overlapped (not necessarily 'touch' but the angle makes them look
like a whole shape? 


Let data talk. How unreliable, how inaccurate the above method is?

I will use CNN, RNN, LSTM to show the image recognition results.

Model:

So far, I deem either image processing or radar detection or the combination of the two can work very well, so deep learning will be required. I want to let my learn under what kind of circumstances should the car stop instead of recognize 'there is a (temporory) stop sign'.
